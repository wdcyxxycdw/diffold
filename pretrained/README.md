## About

RhoFold+ is a deep learning model for accurately predicting RNA 3D structures from input sequences.
It uses evolutionary information from MSA as well as embeddings from our pre-trained large RNA language model, RNA-FM.
The work has been published in Nature Methods (<a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02487-0'>full text available</a>).
This huggingface repository contains the pre-trained models to reproduce the results and apply RhoFold+ for new RNA sequences.

The full codes are available at GitHub:

- Official protocol: https://github.com/WangJiuming/rhofold_protocol
